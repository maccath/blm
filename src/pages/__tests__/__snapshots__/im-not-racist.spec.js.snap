      I'm not racist!
    </h1>
    <p>
      Few people are actively racist. I'm assuming that you're not a member of
the KKK or a supporter of any far-right political parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      The problem is that we live within a white supremacist system; it is
comfortable for us, because it meets our needs. No matter what obstacles
we have had to overcome in order to make it through life; the colour of
our skin has never hindered us in any material way. That's not to say that
white people never suffer; clearly, we do - but we do not suffer because
we are white.
    </p>
    <p>
      This means that we have 'privilege'. Just like how those of us in the
upper classes have 'financial privilege' when compared to those in
poverty, we can also have the privilege of white skin, the privilege of
ability, or the privilege of being male.
    </p>
    <p>
      This privilege does not make us bad people - after all, we didn't choose
the hand we were dealt in life. It just means that we have an advantage.
We are able to use this advantage for social good.
